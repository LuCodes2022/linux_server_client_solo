# Virtual Machine Set Up
## What Do We Need?
- Two virtual machines
- both have storage etc set according to the ubuntu requirements.
## How Do You Actually Set Them Up?
First, we need to download virtual box from its website and select the one that corresponds to our OS. In my case that will be Fedora.

So first we select Linux distribution systems.

Then we select fedora, in my case 37.

Then we wait for it to download. Once it is don we open virtual Box. For the next step we will need to have an ISO image for Ubuntu. To see how to do that you can do so [here](./UBUNTU.md).
